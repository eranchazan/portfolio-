	  <h1>I</h1>'ve loved maps ever since I was a young child. In fourth grade my teacher gave me the nickname "map man" because of my obsession with geography, and willingness to help the teacher give geography lessons. More recently, I took my love of geography to college where I was introduced to geospatial and information technology - which I have continued to  study to this day. I'm a recent graduate of Bloc, a boot camp immersion program, where I learned front end web development. I  am an aspiring web map developer with a focus on data visualization and cartographic design, and am currently looking for job opportunities. This portfolio showcases some of my work over the past several years.
