	  <h1>E</h1>ver since a young child I've loved maps. In fourth grade my teacher nicknamed me 'map man' due to this obsession. I once even helped the teacher give geography lessons. More recently, I took my love of geography with me to college where I was introduced to GIS. It was at this time that I began emersing myself in geosptatial technology which has led me to the career path I aspire to today. I'm currently an aspiring web map developer with a focus in contemporary political, economoical, sport, and cultural data visualization. I'm a current grauate of Bloc.io, a Frontend Web Development Bootcamp program and currently looking for a job. I created this website to showcase my work fom the past several years.
